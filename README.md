# PromiseRacer
This is a simple case of Promise - Callback Function works

In this case, we will define 5 variables which we name "peserta1", "peserta2", "peserta3", "peserta4", and "peserta5". Each "peserta" has their own setTimeout.

The aim of this program is simple. The program will issue the winner who has the smallest Timeout (or in this case the fastest) where we know that the winner is the "peserta2".

By using the Promise Function, we can use 2 types of methods which are adjusted to the existing conditions. We use "then" to output a success result, and "catch" to output a failed result
